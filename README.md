# Vox-Populi-Translation-Framework v2.2.15
The Framework contains all data that are needed to translate Vox Populi to different languages.
It can be used to translate the project to a new not yet existing language.
Furthermore, if Vox Populi receives an update, you will be able to track all changes that are needed in your language pack by looking at the commits of the Translation Framework, keeping your translation always up-to-date and the update procedure as easy as possible.
